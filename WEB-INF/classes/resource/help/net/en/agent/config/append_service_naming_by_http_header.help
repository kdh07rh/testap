This option is used when adding to the default application name using value included in the HTTP header.
The general application naming can be configured from the administrator screen. However, this option is used in specific situations when setting application name using HTTP header value is required.

For example, when the HTTP header contents are as follows

  HTTP Header = {user = Tester, guid = 1234567890}

  You can enter the HTTP header keys for this option (multiple values can be separated by line break )
    user
    guid
    
  Then the application name is then will be shown as 
    /index.aspx+Tester+1234567890
