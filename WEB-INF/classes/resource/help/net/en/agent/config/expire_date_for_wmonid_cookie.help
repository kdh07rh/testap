Option to set the expiration date of a WMONID cookie issued by a Agent.
A WMONID cookie is valid for 365 days from the date of issue by default, and you can change the period of validity with this option.
If you want to validate the WMONID cookie only for the browser session according to security requirements, set the option value to -1.

If a WMONID cookie has been issued, the applicable cookie issued should be deleted first.
