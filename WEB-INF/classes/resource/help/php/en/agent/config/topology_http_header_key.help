When [topology_mode](./agentHelp?type=3&key=topology_mode) is activated, transaction connection information is transmitted via the HTTP Header, and this option configures the HTTP Header key.

Although the key value is set to "X-J_HTTP_TUID_" by default, if the same key is already in use, you can designate a different value.
