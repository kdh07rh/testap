There are cases to judge whether or not the connection is normal by removing the dummy SQL for test purposes when FrameWork is used, and in such case, a large amount of SQLs are left in the profile, which makes it difficult to view the actual SQL.
In this case, when you are registering SQLs that you want to remove from the profile, the applicable SQLs don't collect the profile information.

    select 1
    select 1 from dual

In addition to such SQLs, you can remove SQLs from the profile by registering specific SQLs.
