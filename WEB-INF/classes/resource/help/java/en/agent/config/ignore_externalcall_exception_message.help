If an EXTERNALCALL_EXCEPTION exception occurs in a transaction and the string set is included in the exception message, this option handles it as a normal ExternalCall.

The following is an Exception example.

    java.lang.Exception: ExternalCall Error ...
    ...


When a SERVICE_EXCEPTION exception occurs in a transaction, if the string set is included in the exception message, this option processes it as a normal transaction.

If the option is set, EXTERNALCALL_EXCEPTION errors and events in transaction data are ignored.
