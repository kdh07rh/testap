When the WCF payload is in an XML file format, if the name of a designated method is identical to the name of a factor, the value of the corresponding node is read and added to the profile data. In a multiple configuration, comma (,) is used as a separator. 
 
  [wcf_method_name]:[wcf_paramter_name][,[...:...],...]
 
 For example, if the names of factors for the names of MyMethod1 and MyMethod 2 in the WCF service are connectionString and mode, respectively, and you want to add the values to the XView profile, you can configure them as follows. 
 
  MyMethod1:connectionString,MyMethod2:mode
 
 Subsequently, if MyMethod1 and MyMethod2 are called from the WCF service, you will see the following X-View profile information.
 
  WCF_PARAM=[...connectionstring...]
  WCF_PARAM=[...mode...]
