This option operates only when the [enable_jdbc_wrapper](./agentHelp?key=enable_jdbc_wrapper&type=1) option or [enable_jdbc_vendor_wrapper](./agentHelp?key=enable_jdbc_vendor_wrapper&type=1) option is activated.

Agent tracks Uncommit/Rollback for execute, executeBatch and executeUpdate of java.sql.Statement object, and when a specific application is selected via java.sql.Statement execute, an error is registered that the transaction has closed the connection without commit/rollback. When this option is activated, the foregoing error is not detected.

When a transaction occurs without activating the option, the following profile information is added and a DB_UN_COMMIT_ROLLBACK error occurs.

    ...
    [0016][12:30:34 366][    0][  364] SQL-EXECUTE-QUERY [2 ms]
                                       select * from sample
    ...
    [0017][12:30:34 369][    3][     ] TRY TO CLOSE CONNECTION WITHOUT TRANSACTION COMMIT/ROLLBACK
    [0018][12:30:34 370][    1][  367] DB_CLOSE_CONNECTION (jdbc/sample) [0 ms]
    ...

An example of this error message is shown below.

    DB_UN_COMMIT_ROLLBACK   
    LAST EXECUTED SQL: sql:[select * from sample]

    CONNECTION closed:
    JDBC Transaction NOT Commit/Rollback

The example information shown above can be viewed when selecting the transaction on the X-view pop-up window.
 
 ** For a long-term basis, it is recommended to modify the applicable source code to make the SELECT string be processed by executeQuery method.
