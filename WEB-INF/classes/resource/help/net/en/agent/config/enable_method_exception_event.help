For a method (dynamic method profiling) that is subject to BCI(ByteCode Instrumentation),
this option determines whether to generate a "METHOD_EXCEPTION" event when an exception occurs.

The default value is set to false, and when an exception occurs, a "ToString()" message for the applicable exception is added to the profile information of the transaction.

The following shows an example of profile added.

    ...
    [0124][17:03:42 958][    0][     ] System.Void WebCore.IoContainer.GetInfo(System.String) [1,616 ms]
    [0128][17:03:42 958][    0][     ] System.ApplicationException:  ...
    ...

When the option is set to true, a "METHOD_EXCEPTION" event is generated when an exception occurs.

    To be notified of the event, activate the notification option in the "Management > Evnet Rules" page.
