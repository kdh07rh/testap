This option can be used to generate "SQL_EXCEPTION" event when an SQL exception is occurred when an SQL is running.

Default value of this option is false, the profile information of the transaction is added to the "toString()" message of the exception

The following is sample profile 

    ...
    [0021][13:25:18 086][    3][  320] SQL-EXECUTE-QUERY [10 ms]
                                       select * from crud2

    [0022][13:25:18 097][   11][     ] javax.servlet.ServletException: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
    ...

Please refer to [adapter_method](./agentHelp?key=adapter_method&type=1) option if you are looking for adding simple message to the stack output of the exception
