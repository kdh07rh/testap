The user IP is obtained by referring to the REMOTE_ADDR header value of the wsgi environment variable. If there is a separate HTTP Header, the key name can be assigned to remote_address_header_key. Note that in the case of wsgi, all dash ('-') characters in the HTTP Header in the environment variable are replaced with underscore characters, so it must be specified accordingly.

For example, if the desired HTTP Header key name is "X-FORWARDED-FOR", the remote_address_header_key value is set to "X_FORWARDED_FOR".
