$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] is used when obtaining a user IP address, and the address of a proxy server may be returned depending on the network environment. Sometimes, the user address is delivered from the proxy server via a separate HTTP header, and you can designate the name of header with the remote_address_header_key option.
