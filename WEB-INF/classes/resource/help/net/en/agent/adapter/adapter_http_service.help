Defines the default tracking method when tracking a transaction for an HTTP service.
 
  public interface IAdapterHttpService 
  {
  bool reject(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject);
  bool rejectMessage(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject);
  void start(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject);
  void end(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject, Exception t);
  void interceptServicePerformance(Object xvpoint);
  }
 
 Description of method
 ---------------
 reject(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject);
 : Rejects an HTTP service. Although PLC processing is generally used, this method is customized when the intent is to process the PLC function based on the user IP or other input value. If the return value is true, the user request is rejected.
 
 rejectMessage(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject);
 : Re-defines when sending a customized message as an HTTP service request is rejected. If the return value is true, it indicates that an appropriate message has already been sent to the user.
 
  bool b = rejectMessage(request, response, o);
  if (b == false)
  {
  // If not re-defined by the adapter,
  // the default message defined by JENNIFER's .NET is processed
  }
 
 start(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject);
 : Used to initialize additional tracking information when an HTTP service starts.
 
 end(Object request, Object response, Object activeObject, Exception t);
 : Used to verify or modify the information tracked with JENNIFER at the time when an HTTP service ends.
 
 interceptServicePerformance(Object xvpoint);
 : Used immediately before transmitting the service performance information (XViewPoint) to the server.
 
 
 ** How to configure **
 
 Save the class source file implementing an adapter in the [JENNIFER installation folder]/extension folder, then perform validation using the verify_script.bat file located in the extension folder. If the validation is successfully completed, set the file name of a source code validated in the adapter_http_service item on the advanced options page through the JENNIFER console.
