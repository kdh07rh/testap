This option is a number with which SQL collected by the agent is transmitted to the data server and the hash information of the applicable SQL is cached.
The reason for caching the hash of SQL separately is to prevent re-transmission of the same SQL to the data server.

If the cache data exceeds the set value, the hash of the SQL entering earlier is deleted according to the FIFO (First In First Out) method.
