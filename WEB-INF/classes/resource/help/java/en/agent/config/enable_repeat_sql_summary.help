If you use PreparedStatement to execute the same SQL query, and only changing the parameters through a loop, you may experience performance problems when the number of profiles is increased.

This option option can be used to collect profile data limited by the number defined by the [repeat_sql_summary_count](./agentHelp?key=repeat_sql_summary_count&type=1) option and the rest of the profile information is summarized

The following summarized information is added to the profile.

    ex) "REPEAT_SQL : total count = 10000, total time = 34892 (19719030)"
