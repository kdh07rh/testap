This option is used to determining whether to use guid passed from the calling side to the current transaction when receiving request using RMI remote method invocation

AGENT can recognize RMI invocation without AGENT's GUID, but if user want to set GUID value from remote call, then this option can be used.

The default value is false, if this option was set to true the current transaction GUID will be set from the GUID value received

Note that the GUID value must be present in the caller transaction.



    [0001][14:33:50 398][    0][     ] SET GUID(from RMI)=2506379062092865680
