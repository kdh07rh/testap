When the user initially uses a web application provided in the http://www.domain.com domain name, a wmonid cookie value is assigned.
However, as it is not possible to read the wmonid cookie value assigned in the foregoing application even if this user accesses a web service provided in the http://sales.domain.com domain name, a new wmonid cookie value is assigned. 
Therefore, this user is counted twice even though the access is made by the same user.

Depending on the situation, it would be appropriate to distinguish by domain name even when it is physically the same user, as stated above.
However, to identify this user as a single user, this option should be used.

    .domain.com

wmonid_cookie_domain option value must start with [.].
If this option is activated, a user accessing via IP address rather than domain name does not affect the number of concurrent users and visitors.
