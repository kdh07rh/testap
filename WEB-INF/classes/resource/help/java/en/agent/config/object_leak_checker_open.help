This option is an option that determines whether a method of a specific object has been executed with the [object_leak_checker_close](./agentHelp?Key=object_leak_checker_close&type=1) options.

You can use this option if you want to track resource leak with two options. The scope of the check is limited to the scope of the transaction and can be set up to 10.

For example, setting a method that obtains a connection in relation to a DB connection causes the OPEN profile to be written when the set method is executed.

If the [object_leak_checker_close](./agentHelp?Key=object_leak_checker_close&type=1) option is not set at the end of the transaction or if the actual set method is not executed even after setting it, the USER_DEFINED_LEAK error could prevent the leak from occurring.
