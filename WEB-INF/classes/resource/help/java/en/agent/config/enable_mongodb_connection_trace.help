The option to set up to monitor the connection status of MongoDB
This option is enabled by default, it count the number of classes in a connection that corresponds to each driver.

This method is the same as the method for counting the number of objects in the JDBC connection.
The number of connections the WAS calling to MongoDB for each IP is collected on per-port basis

Idle and Active connection are only collected.

One thing to note is if you set up the Connection Pool JMX: you can see the number of connections on a port-by-port basis.
When JMX is not set, the number of all connections by summing the MongoDB Instanc will be shown
