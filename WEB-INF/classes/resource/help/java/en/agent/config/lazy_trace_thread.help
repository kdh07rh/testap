Depending on the specific environment, the java.lang.Thread option may affect the timing of the patch, which may slow down the patch time.

If the option is false, the java.lang.Thread class is patched at the agent initialization time.

If the option is true, the patch point of the java.lang.Thread class is patched after the first transaction is performed.
