To collect the application name, the application name is sent to the server at the beginning of the transaction.

If the application name is changed and collected separately, the changed application name is transmitted to the server again before the transaction is completed while keeping the change.

Te **send_transaction_name_on_active_service** option is required to prevent unnecessary application name transmission at the beginning of a transaction when the application name is long.
