To get system memory utilization, use the /proc/meminfo file on Linux.
It uses the "MemFree" column for free memory, which does not include the "Buffers/Cached" value.

This can sometimes result in a high utilization rate, and you have the option to use the "MemAvailable" value instead of the "MemFree" value when calculating this number.
