This option is a number with which text collected by the agent is transmitted to the data server and the hash information of the applicable text is cached.
The reason for caching the hash of text separately is to prevent re-transmission of the same SQL to the data server.

If the cache data exceeds the set value, the hash of the text entering earlier is deleted according to the FIFO (First In First Out) method.

The kinds of texts cached by the [max_number_of_text](./agentHelp?key=max_number_of_text&type=1) option are as follows.

* Application name
