When looking for SQL patches, we only get the patch time if the number of patches is greater than or equal to zero.
In this case, it sometimes takes time to check if there are any patches, which can make it hard to tell if the patching is slow or the SQL is slow.
By enabling the option, the patch time will be calculated regardless of the number of patches, allowing you to split the time between SQL and patch time for a more accurate picture.
