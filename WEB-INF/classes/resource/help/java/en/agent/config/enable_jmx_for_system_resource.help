System resources (CPU,Memory) by default are collected using JMX (Java Management Extensions) except for Linux-based OS


If JMX is not supported by the JVM, then set this option to "false", and system resources information must be gathered using the JNI settings

If this option is enabled, you might see similar log to the following

    ...
