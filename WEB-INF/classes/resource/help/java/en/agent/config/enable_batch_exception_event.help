The **enable_batch_exception_event** option is an option to create a "BATCH_EXCEPTION" event when an exception occurs in the Job or Step stage in Spring Batch..

The default value is fasle. If it set to true and an exception occurs, "BATCH_EXCEPTION" is generated as an event.

 To receive the event as a notification, this is set to the notification of "Management -> Event Rules".


If the option is disabled, the "toString()" message of the exception is added to the transaction profile when an exception occurs,

    Note that the exception is valid only when the exception occured is passed to the parent method. This option may not apply for each version.
