The number of active services is collected every seconds, and a service dump is left when the number of times that the number of active services exceeds the value set in [dump_active_service](./agentHelp?key=dump_active_service&type=3) is equal to or larger than the value set in this option.

In other words, if the value of this option is 3, a service dump is left when the number of active services collected for 3 seconds (actives service collection interval (1 second) * [dump_active_service_over_count](./agentHelp?key=dump_active_service_over_count&type=3)) is equal to or larger than the value set in the [dump_active_service](./agentHelp?key=dump_active_service&type=3).

    For reference, if only the default value is used, a service dump is left when the number of active services for 3 seconds is equal to or larger than 100. When the number of active services for 3 seconds drops below 100, the time is counted again from the beginning.
