Set the maximum number of profile collection and storage of transactions.

If this value is 1000, the number of profile collections per transaction cannot exceed 1000.

The difference from the **[profile_max_size](./agentHelp?key=profile_max_size&type=1)** option is that SQL and ExternalCall profiles are included in the this option.

File-related profile data is always collected.
