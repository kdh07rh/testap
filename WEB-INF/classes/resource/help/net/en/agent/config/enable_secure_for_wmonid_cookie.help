When this option is set to True, Secure property is configured at the time of issuing a WMONID cookie used by the agent.

After configuring the applicable option, a header similar to the following is added to the header at the time of responding to the application request.

â€»Precautions

    As the Secure property of a cookie determines whether the cookie will be sent using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or not, a cookie is not issued when using ordinary HTTP.
    When using the Secure property, you must use the HTTPS protocol.
