This option is for method profiing of Lamda expression with JDK 8 or highter

Class name is shown like below if class is created with Lamda expression..

    Example$$Lambda$1


Basically, profiling for anonymous classes is not allowed, so it can work with the following options in the configuration file.

    _ignore_anonymous_class = false


Note :
Even if the option is used, it is not possible to profile all lambda expressions and anonymous classes..
