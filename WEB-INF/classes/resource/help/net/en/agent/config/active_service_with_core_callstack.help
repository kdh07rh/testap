Because .NET Core 3/5+ environments operate asynchronously, you cannot get the call stack. Instead, if you set this option to true, you can use the same tool, such as dotnet-dump, to include the stack of all calls made to that application in a detailed view of the active service.

It's important to note that obtaining a call stack with this option temporarily halts the application's runtime. In most cases, this will be for a few tens milliseconds to tens of seconds, which you can see in the logs left behind by "# snapshot: ...".

(This option is not supported for .NET Core 1.0 through 3.0 environments)
