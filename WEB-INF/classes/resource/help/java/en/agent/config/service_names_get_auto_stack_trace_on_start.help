This option is used if you want to collect automatic stack trace information at the same time as the transaction starts.
It can help you find the cause of the application's initial delay or gap in the application's ending quickly.
Select and register the target application names that you want to monitor to reduce the performance impact of all transactions.

If the transaction's rename has been applied, you will need to set the collect_original_service_naming advanced option to register the name of the application that is output to the profile.
