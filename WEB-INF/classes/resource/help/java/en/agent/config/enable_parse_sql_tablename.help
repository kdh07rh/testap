This option is used to prevent the phenomenon in which too many different SQL numbers are generated from an application using a temporary table.
A temporary table refers to a table name containing a number, and collecting names and numbers separately enables tracking SQL with minimized redundancy.

The following is an example of a frequently used temporary table. 

    SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_20150101
    SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_20150102
    SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_001
    SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_002

** It is recommended to check before changing to the value to True as the use of a temporary table does not frequently occur.
