This option is used to prevent the presence of too many SQL numbers in an application using a temporary table. A temporary table indicates too many numbers in the name of the table, and it is possible to enable SQL tracking by minimizing the redundancy through separating and collecting names and numbers.
 
 The following is an example of a frequently used temporary table. 
 
  SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_20150101
  SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_20150102
  SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_001
  SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_002
 
 ** It is recommended to check before changing the value to True, as the use of a temporary table does not frequently occur.
