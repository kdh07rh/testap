This options is used when Spring Boot works with Tomcat instead of default WAS..

When WAS is changed, Reactor-related monitoring does not work only by setting the [enable_reactor](./agentHelp?key=enable_reactor&type=1) option.

In order to do this end, BCI (ByteCode Instrumentation) is performed on the class added with this option.

Please, disable the option if you don't want to monitor asynchronous servlets and Reactor.
