Depending on the vendor, the javaagent option may not work correctly in the JVM state.
In particular, when redefining classes, it sometimes behaves abnormally or affects performance. Previously, the redefine-classes option was disabled and recompressed to set up the agent.
To handle this in the program, we added this option.

It is important to note that the behavior of disabling this option may be different from the behavior of handling it in the program.
