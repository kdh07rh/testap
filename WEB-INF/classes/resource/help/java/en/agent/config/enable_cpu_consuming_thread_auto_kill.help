This option is used to automatically terminates the transaction thread when the CPU is used for a certain period of time.

If this option is set to true, the value of the [cpu_consuming_thread_auto_kill_threshold] (./agentHelp? Key = cpu_consuming_thread_auto_kill_threshold & type = 1) option must be set to a value greater than zero.

Caution when applying this option because it will forcefully terminate the transaction thread running longer than the specified time.

If you attempt to terminate the thread, the following is displayed in the agent log:

     [TRACE] [I033] tried to kill cpu consuming thread /cpu_and_sleep.jsp (77 ms) 2018-04-30 / 16: 16:
