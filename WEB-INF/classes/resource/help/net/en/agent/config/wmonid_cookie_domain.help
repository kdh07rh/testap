When the user initially uses a web application provided in the http://www.jennifersoft.com domain name, a wmonid cookie value is assigned.
 However, as it is not possible to read the wmonid cookie value assigned in the foregoing application if this user accesses a web service provided in the http://sales.jennifersoft.com domain name, a new wmonid cookie value is assigned. 
 Therefore, this user is counted twice even though the access is performed by the same user.
 
 Even when it is physically the same user, as described above, it would be appropriate to perform a calculation for each domain name depending on the situation. However, to count this user as the same user, the wmonid_cookie_domain option should be enabled.
 
  .jennifersoft.com
 
 wmonid_cookie_domain option value must start with [.].
 If this option is activated, a user accessing via an IP address rather than a domain name does not affect the number of concurrent users and visitors.
