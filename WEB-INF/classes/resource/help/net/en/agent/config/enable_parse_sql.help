This option is used to minimize the redundant SQLs by processing all numbers and single quoted values into variables when collecting SQLs.
 
 A number is converted into '#', and a single quoted value is converted into a '$' variable.
 
 An example conversion is shown below.
 
  SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_123 WHERE COL = 'A'
  
  SELECT * FROM EXAMPLE_# WHERE COL = '$'
