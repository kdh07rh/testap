When a SERVICE_EXCEPTION exception occurs in a transaction, if the string set is included in the exception message, this option processes it as a normal transaction.

    java.lang.Exception: Error ...
    ...


When the above exception occurs, a part of the exception message is registered and is used  to process the exception normally. ("Error ...")

If the option is set, SERVICE_EXCEPTION errors and events in transaction data are ignored.
