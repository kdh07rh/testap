This option is used to reload a customized adapter (adapter_http_service, adapter_service, etc.) by JENNIFER's .NET agent while running.
 
 For example, if the value of current adapter_revision is changed from 0 to 1, JENNIFER's .NET agent reloads the customized adapter registered. Regardless of whether the value is increased or decreased, it is only necessary to change to a value that is not equal to the previous one.
