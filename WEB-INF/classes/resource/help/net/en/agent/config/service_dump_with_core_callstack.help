The .NET Core 3/5+ environment operates asynchronously, so you cannot get the call stack. Instead, if you set this option to true, you can use the same tool, such as dotnet-dump, to include the call stack of all running applications in the service dump.

It's important to note that obtaining the call stack with this option temporarily halts the application's runtime. In most cases, this will be for a few tens milliseconds to tens of seconds, which you can see in the logs left in the service dump file as "# snapshot: ...".

(This option is not supported for .NET Core 1.0 through 3.0 environments)
